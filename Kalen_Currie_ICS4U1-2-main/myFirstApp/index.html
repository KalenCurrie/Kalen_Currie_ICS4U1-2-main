                    Hello my name is Kalen Currie, I am currently in grade 12 planning to go to collage
                    to study in a course called <br>electromechanical engineering technology - mechatronics.
                    My future goals in the technology feild is to persue <br>in a engineering field for a fun and
                    interesting job.
                </br>

            <br>
            
                <br>
                    My experience in the tech field is quite all over the place. At the moment I am in the robotics club. Last year in the 2023 robotics season <br>I was part of the
                    programming team. I did some coding for the team but sadly was not used in the final robot code, but thats fine! <br>It was fun and I definity learned one thing or two.
                </br>
                
                <br>
                    One other cool thing kinda in the tech field is that I created my own game. The game I created was created on the ROBLOX platfrom. <br>I used the coding language Lua when 
                    Creating the game. It was fun creating the game and coding it but I eventually got burnned out.

                <br>

                <br>
                    One final thing I made is last year in Grade 11, me and a group created a type of radar that scans for objects infront of a <br>ultrasonic sensor.
                    The main purpose of this was to catch anyone trying to leave the classroom without the teacher knowlage so that teachers will <br> hear a noise
                    knowing someone is trying to leave.
